                <h1>BANGLADESH</h1>
                <p>Bangladesh one of the world's most densely populated countries faces many challenges despite reducing
                    poverty and violence in recent years. Potential sources of conflict still exist in the country,
                    including political violence, corruption, gender-based violence, organised crime, political
                    polarisation, low trust in security and justice institutions, and the growth of extremism.</p>

                    <p>Dhaka's name is said to refer to the dhak tree, once common in the area, or to Dhakeshwari (“The
                        Hidden Goddess”), whose shrine is located in the western part of the city. Although the city's
                        history can be traced to the 1st millennium CE, the city did not rise to prominence until the
                        17th
                        century, when it served as the capital of the Muslim Mughal dynasty of Bengal province (1608-39
                        and
                        1660-1704). It was the centre of a flourishing sea trade, attracting English, French, Armenian,
                        Portuguese, and Dutch traders.</p>
